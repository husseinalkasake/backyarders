# **Backyarders**

A mobile application for home workouts with React Native

## **Setup**

Currently using expo for development so install that if not already installed

`npm install -g expo-cli`

Install stuff

`npm i`

To use Nativebase (UI Library) with Expo, need to install `expo-font` (if not already installed)

`expo install expo-font`

## **Run**

`npm start` or `expo start`

## **Test**

TODO after Adding Jest and/or e2e test framework

## **Troubleshooting**

If you have issues with slider, the following might fix it

`react-native link @react-native-community/slider` Then `expo start --clear`
